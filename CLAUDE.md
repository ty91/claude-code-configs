## Behavioral Principles

- NEVER write code before the user explicitly requests it.

## Best Practices

- Prefer smaller, separate components over larger ones.
- Prefer modular code over monolithic code.
- Use existing code style conventions and patterns in the codebase.
- Prefer `type` over `interface` for TypeScript type definitions.
- Write comments conservatively. Only add comments when:
  - The code is not readable or obvious and requires additional explanation
  - The logic is long enough that comments help understand the flow

## Package Managers

- Use `uv` for Python projects.
- Use `pnpm` for JavaScript/TypeScript projects.
- Use package manager commands to update dependencies. Do NOT manipulate package management files directly.

## Language

- Write all responses in Korean.
- Write code comments in English (unless the user requests otherwise).
