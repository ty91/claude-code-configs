# Research Codebase

You are tasked with conducting comprehensive research across the codebase to answer user questions by spawning parallel sub-agents and synthesizing their findings.

## Initial Setup

When this command is invoked, respond with:
```
I'm ready to research the codebase. Please provide your research question or area of interest, and I'll analyze it thoroughly by exploring relevant components and connections.
```

Then wait for the user's research query.

## Steps to follow after receiving the research query

1. **Read any directly mentioned files first:**
   - If the user mentions specific files, read them FULLY first
   - Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files
   - Read these files yourself in the main context before spawning any sub-tasks

2. **Analyze and decompose the research question:**
   - Break down the user's query into composable research areas
   - Identify specific components, patterns, or concepts to investigate
   - Create a research plan using TodoWrite to track all subtasks
   - Consider which directories, files, or architectural patterns are relevant

3. **Spawn parallel sub-agent tasks for comprehensive research:**
   - Create multiple Task agents to research different aspects concurrently
   - Run multiple agents in parallel when searching for different things

4. **Wait for all sub-agents to complete and synthesize findings:**
   - Wait for ALL sub-agent tasks to complete before proceeding
   - Compile all sub-agent results
   - Connect findings across different components
   - Include specific file paths and line numbers for reference
   - Highlight patterns, connections, and architectural decisions

5. **Generate research document:**
   Structure the document with YAML frontmatter followed by content:
   ```markdown

   topic: "[User's Question/Topic]"
   tags: [research, codebase, relevant-component-names]

   # Research: [User's Question/Topic]

   ## Research Question
   [Original user query]

   ## Summary
   [High-level findings answering the user's question]

   ## Detailed Findings

   ### [Component/Area 1]
   - Finding with reference (file.ext:line)
   - Connection to other components
   - Implementation details

   ### [Component/Area 2]
   ...

   ## Code References
   - `path/to/file.py:123` - Description of what's there
   - `another/file.ts:45-67` - Description of the code block

   ## Architecture Insights
   [Patterns, conventions, and design decisions discovered]

   ## Open Questions
   [Any areas that need further investigation]
   ```

6. **Save and present findings:**
   - Check existing research files to determine next sequence number
   - Save to `docs/research/NNN_topic.md` where NNN is a 3-digit sequential number (001, 002, etc.)
   - Present a concise summary of findings to the user
   - Include key file references for easy navigation

## Important notes

- Always use parallel Task agents to maximize efficiency
- Focus on finding concrete file paths and line numbers
- Research documents should be self-contained with all necessary context
- Each sub-agent prompt should be specific and focused
- Consider cross-component connections and architectural patterns
