# Task Plan

## Goal
<!--
  WHAT: Clear, measurable objective for this task.
  WHY: Answers "Where am I going?" in the 5-Question Reboot Test.
  EXAMPLE: "Implement user authentication with JWT tokens and role-based access control"
-->

[Describe the goal here]

## Current State Analysis
<!--
  WHAT: What exists now, what's working, what's missing.
  WHY: Establishes baseline and identifies gaps.
  INCLUDE: Key files, current behavior, limitations.
-->

[Describe current state]

## Desired End State
<!--
  WHAT: Specification of the desired end state.
  WHY: Clear success definition, enables verification.
  INCLUDE: Expected behavior, measurable outcomes.
-->

[Describe desired end state]

## What We're NOT Doing
<!--
  WHAT: Explicitly out-of-scope items.
  WHY: Prevents scope creep, sets clear boundaries.
  EXAMPLE: "Not implementing OAuth - only username/password auth"
-->

- [Out of scope item 1]
- [Out of scope item 2]

## Implementation Approach
<!--
  WHAT: High-level strategy and reasoning.
  WHY: Documents the "why" behind technical choices.
-->

[Describe approach and reasoning]

## Current Phase
<!--
  WHAT: Which phase you're currently working on.
  WHY: Answers "Where am I?" - quick reference for resuming work.
  UPDATE: Change this as you progress through phases.
-->
