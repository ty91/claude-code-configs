# Findings

<!--
  WHAT: Your research notebook - everything you learn goes here.
  WHY: Answers "What have I learned?" in the 5-Question Reboot Test.
  RULE: **2-Action Rule** - After 2 search/read operations, write findings here immediately.
        Don't wait. Don't trust your context window. Write it down.
-->

## Requirements
<!--
  WHAT: What the user actually needs (may differ from what they asked for).
  WHY: Prevents scope creep and ensures alignment.
  WHEN: Fill in during initial planning, update as requirements clarify.
-->

### Explicit Requirements
<!-- What the user directly asked for -->
-

### Implicit Requirements
<!-- What's implied but not stated (conventions, standards, etc.) -->
-

### Out of Scope
<!-- What we're explicitly NOT doing -->
-

## Research Findings
<!--
  WHAT: What you discovered about the codebase, APIs, patterns, etc.
  WHY: Preserves context that would otherwise be lost.
  WHEN: After EVERY 2 search/read operations (2-Action Rule).
  FORMAT: Include file paths and line numbers for code references.
-->

## Technical Decisions
<!--
  WHAT: Choices made and why.
  WHY: Documents rationale, prevents re-debating.
  WHEN: When you make or change a technical decision.
-->

### [Decision Title]
- **Options Considered**:
  1. [Option A] - [Pros/Cons]
  2. [Option B] - [Pros/Cons]
- **Decision**: [What we chose]
- **Rationale**: [Why]

## Issues Encountered
<!--
  WHAT: Problems discovered during research or implementation.
  WHY: Tracks blockers, documents solutions for future reference.

## Resources
<!--
  WHAT: Useful links, files, and references.
  WHY: Quick access to important information.
-->

### Key Files
<!-- Files central to this task -->
- `path/to/file.ts` - [Description]

### Documentation
<!-- Relevant docs, guides, specs -->

<!--
  REMINDER: 2-Action Rule
  After 2 search/read operations, STOP and write findings here.
  Your context window is not reliable. The filesystem is.
